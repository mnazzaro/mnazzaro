Hey! 

I'm Mark Nazzaro, a computer science student living outside of Washington, DC. Although data science, natural language processing, and machine learning are my 
primary interests,  also dabble in game development, fullstack development and a whole bunch of other random nonsense! I'm also a freelancer, so if my experience
matches your needs, please reach me at marknazzaro2@gmail.com! I'll respond within 1 business day.
